    <h2>My Initial Reaction</h2>
    <p>When I first started my GA homework assignnment, I must admit that the task seemed pretty daunting. For a newbie like me, it was almost like trying to learn digital Chinese! Nevertheless, I was SO anxious to get going with each lesson and learn as much as I could until the work felt more comfortable. I constantly had to tone down my excitement just so I could focus and reasses the information I was learning in order not to get ahead of myself.

    <h2>Learning Code for Beginners</h2>
    <p>I must say that the GA Dash website is a godsend for those who have no idea how to code and where to start. The tutorials are well designed, fun and extremely user friendly! The lessons let you go at your own pace and make it easy for you to troubleshoot and recheck your work while learning the initial basic coding principles. I love that you can see your work on the accompanying screen to the right which develops as you enter codes and commands. Dash does an excellent job of anticipating questions a new user might have, and answers them simply without overwhelming you with lengthy coding jargon.</p>

    <h2>Beginner's Advice</h2>
    <p>As a new user myself, I would advise all newcomers to take your time and reread EVERYTHING. The steps in the lessons are pretty self explanatory so as long as you follow them to the letter you'll do just fine. Take advantage of the site's Skills, Lesson and Q+A Forum links for helpful hints when you get lost or flustered with any of the coding info. You can also go back to previous tutorial pages or simply start over if you get a little confused. Lastly, it helps to tackle this assignment in an environment conducive for studying while at the same time working on a decent laptop, (unlike MINE which kept knocking me offline and freezing while I tried to complete the tasks!) Whatever you do, DON'T GIVE UP, push through and definitely enjoy this experience that GA makes so incredible!!! <a href="http://gafewd.github.io/">JOIN GA</a></p>
