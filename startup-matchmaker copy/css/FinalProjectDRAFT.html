    <h2>My Initial Reaction</h2>
    <p>I must admit that on my first day of FEWD, I was anxiously excited over how class would pan out. I was ready to get started after weeks of pre-enrollment prepping, but also a bit nervous as to whether I'd be able to keep up with the pace of the classroom. For a newbie like me, learning to code was pretty much like trying to learn calculus in Chinese! Nevertheless, I was amped to get going with the course and learn as much as possible until the work felt more comfortable. There were a few curveballs that would briefly throw you for a loop, but Chandler along with his dynamic duo of Mollie and Nate, were very helpful with going over the material and clearly explaining each step until it made sense. With each lesson, the coursework started connecting, and I found that if I did a lot of follow up reading and practice on my own, that I could remain focused and retain most of the info I was learning.</p>

    <h2>Learning Code for Beginners</h2>
    <p>I must say that the GA FEWD is a godsend for those who have no idea how to code or where to start. The tutorials are well designed, fun and extremely user friendly! The artfuly lucid Syllabus along with its inserted CodePens allows you to go at your own pace step by step and makes it easy for you to troubleshoot and recheck your work while learning the initial basic coding principles. I love that you can see your work in the accompanying split-screen which develops as you enter codes and commands. Chandler and company do an excellent job of anticipating questions a new coder might have, and give helpful hints and suggestions without overwhelming you with lengthy coding jargon. More importantly, they always go over the labwork using various coding methods so you can see the correct application for what's being taught.</p>

    <h2>Beginner's Advice</h2>
    <p>As a new user myself, I would advise all newcomers to take your time and reread EVERYTHING. The steps in the lessons are pretty self explanatory, so as long as you follow them to the letter you'll do just fine. Take full advantage of your Coursework Notes for helpful hints and how-to examples whenever you get lost or flustered with any of the coding steps taught in class. You can just as easily ask Chandler, Mollie or Nate for assistance when you get a little confused since they're extremely knowledgable, always available and quick to help. Lastly, it definitely helps to tackle the coding you've learned IN class by going over it again and again OUTSIDE of class, but do so in an environment conducive for studying, whether it's at home, in Starbucks, on park bench, somewhere quiet or even right there in the GA offices alongside other students. Whatever you do, DON'T GIVE UP, push through and definitely enjoy this experience that GA makes pretty incredible!</p>
